To enable CUDA acceleration in tyFlow, ensure you have a CUDA-compatible NVidia GPU and then place these NVidia DLL files in the same location as the tyFlow DLO file. 

Please consult the tyFlow documentation for more information about tyFlow's various CUDA implementations.

These DLLs do not need to be re-downloaded each time you update tyFlow. You will only need to re-download these DLLs if the CUDA/PhysX SDK is updated. If the SDK is updated, it will be noted in the tyFlow version history.
